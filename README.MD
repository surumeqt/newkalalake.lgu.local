# Barangay Resident Information System

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
The Barangay Resident Information System is designed to streamline the management of resident records and barangay-related requests such as certificates, case reports, and other official documents. Traditionally, these processes are handled manually, which can lead to delays, errors, and inefficiencies. This system aims to digitize the workflow, improve record accuracy, and speed up response times for residents.

   - Certificates (residency, clearance, etc.)  
   - Case or incident reports  
   - Other barangay services  
4. **Document Generation** â€“ Once processed, the requested document is auto-generated and made available for printing.  
5. **Logs & Updates** â€“ All actions are stored in activity logs for future reference.
